You are not supposed to touch the ghost type Pokémon, Gasty and Haunter. Yet, Magnetons are safe and you will only bounce back on them. (I'd probably better use Snorlax instead of Magnetons since Snorlax feels more bouncy, but I didn't find a proper png image for Snorlax)

Note the ghosts are ghosts so they can go through entities. (well just don't wanna make collision detections between them :p)

You have a bunch of Squirtle at your destination. Your goal is to reach to Squirtle so that they can help you block the ghosts.
